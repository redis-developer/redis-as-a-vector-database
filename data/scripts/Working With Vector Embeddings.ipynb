    "### Working with Vector Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Search is quickly becoming the norm when looking for contextually rich content across vast amounts of data. Vector embeddings, a method of mathematically representing data points about an object as an array of floats, are compared with each other to discover similarity distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll go through several processes to prepare you to integrate vector embeddings into your application's search capabilities. This codebase is in support of the video [Redis as a Vector Database](https://youtube.com/tbd). The full repository may be found [here](https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-as-a-vector-database.git). To learn more about Vector Databases in Redis, check out our full documentation here or try the Redis University course RU204:Redis as a Vector Database.\n",
