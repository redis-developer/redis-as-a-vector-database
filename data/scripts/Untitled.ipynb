    "### Working with Vector Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll go through several processes to prepare you to integrate vector embeddings into your application's search capabilities. We will cover the following actions:\n",
    "- 1. select a model for embedding existing data fields and query text\n",
    "- 2. convert a text field within a JSON object into a vector embedding\n",
    "- 3. store a vector embedding in a JSON object in Redis\n",
    "- create an index for vector search over a large database of JSON objects\n",
    "- create a query vector embedding to search\n",
    "- perform a vector search on a Redis Vector Database\n",
    "\n",
    "This codebase is in support of the video [Redis as a Vector Database](https://youtube.com/tbd). The full repository may be found [here](https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-as-a-vector-database.git).\n",
    "\n",
    "The database contains approximately 10,000 JSON objects, each representing a science fiction or fantasy book. The description text will be converted into a vector embedding and used for our query examples. Here is an example of a typical JSON book object:\n",
